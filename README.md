# Gemma2b Fine-Tuning on Medicine Usage Dataset

This project fine-tunes the **Gemma2b** model, developed by Google DeepMind, on a **medicine usage** dataset. The goal of the fine-tuning is to create a model that can predict and understand the usage and applications of various medicines based on text data.

## Project Overview

The **Gemma2b** model is fine-tuned to predict the correct usage, effects, and details of various medicines from a dataset containing descriptions and classifications of medicines. This model could be useful for applications like:

- Medicine recommendation systems
- Medical chatbots for answering patient queries
- Assisting healthcare professionals in drug-related decisions

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of text data about different medicines, including their names, uses, side effects, dosage information, and more. The data has been preprocessed and formatted for use with the **Gemma2b** model.

**Dataset Details**:
- Contains **X records** of medicine descriptions.
- Each record includes:
  - Medicine Name
  - Usage Description
  - Side Effects (optional)
  - Recommended Dosage (optional)

## Fine-Tuning Procedure

The following steps were taken to fine-tune **Gemma2b** on the medicine dataset:

1. **Pretrained Model**: We used the pretrained **Gemma2b** model as the base.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The text data was cleaned, tokenized, and encoded using the **SentencePiece** tokenizer.
3. **Training**: The model was fine-tuned on the dataset using a learning rate of `1e-5` and batch size of `16`.
4. **Evaluation**: The fine-tuned model was evaluated on a validation set to measure performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).

## Results

After fine-tuning, the model achieved the following performance metrics on the validation set:

- **Accuracy**: `XX%`
- **F1-score**: `XX`
- **Loss**: `XX`

The model can now predict medicine usage and side effects with a reasonable level of accuracy, making it useful for applications in healthcare and medical fields.
